# dnd_monster_scrape
A simple web scraper for the site https://www.aidedd.org/, certainly some room for improvement if anybody wants to contribute (or if I ever get around to it). Start by calling the shallow scrape, this gets a lot of information about all of the monsters,  however more information can be found on each monster's individual page (if available), this is what the deep scrape does.

## Prerequisites
Check req.txt. I'm using requests, beautiful soup, and pandas.
